## Prerequisites

1. **Install Rust and Cargo**

   Rust is the primary language used in this project. Install Rust and its package manager Cargo:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

   For more detailed instructions, refer to the [official Rust installation guide](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. **Obtain an OpenRouter API Key**

   The system relies on the OpenRouter API for language model interactions such as thought generation, plan creation, memory compression, and context analysis. Sign up and obtain an API key from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) and you can use crypto.

3. **Set Environment Variables**

   Set your API key in the environment variable:

   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your_openrouter_api_key_here'
   ```

   **Optional:** If you plan to use the Google Cloud Gemini model for advanced AI capabilities, set up your Google Cloud project and set the following environment variable:

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT='your_google_cloud_project_id'
   ```

   Ensure you have enabled the necessary APIs in your Google Cloud project and have proper authentication set up. Refer to the [Google Cloud documentation](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication) for guidance.

1. **Emergence** `(-100 to 100)`
   - Measures the development of novel properties and behaviors.
   - Influenced by thought generation and plan execution.

2. **Coherence** `(-100 to 100)`
   - Assesses system stability and coordination.
   - Affected by cell interactions and the success of plans.

3. **Resilience** `(-100 to 100)`
   - Evaluates adaptability to changes and recovery capabilities.
   - Enhanced through responding to challenges.

4. **Intelligence** `(-100 to 100)`
   - Gauges learning ability and decision-making quality.
   - Develops through thought evolution and experience.

5. **Efficiency** `(-100 to 100)`
   - Measures optimal resource utilization.
   - Improves with process optimization and waste reduction.

6. **Integration** `(-100 to 100)`
   - Reflects system connectivity and collaboration.
   - Strengthened by effective communication and teamwork among cells.

### Modules Overview

The project is organized into several key modules:

- **`api`**: Handles interactions with external APIs.
  - `gemini.rs` *(Optional)*: Implements `GeminiClient` for interacting with Google Cloud's Gemini AI Model.
  - `openrouter.rs`: Defines `OpenRouterClient` for making API calls to OpenRouter.
  - `mod.rs`: Exposes API clients for use in other modules.

- **`models`**: Contains data structures and constants.
  - `constants.rs`: Defines global constants for configuration.
  - `knowledge.rs`: Manages the knowledge base loaded from files.
  - `plan_analysis.rs`: Provides functionalities to analyze and save plan data.
  - `thought_io.rs`: Defines structures for event inputs and outputs.
  - `types.rs`: Defines core types like `CellContext`, `Thought`, `Plan`, and statistical data structures.
  - `mod.rs`: Exports commonly used types and structures.

- **`systems`**: Implements the core simulation logic.
  - `cell.rs`: Defines the `Cell` struct and its behaviors.
  - `colony.rs`: Manages the colony of cells and oversees simulation cycles.
  - `ltl.rs`: Implements logic for interaction effects and local temporal logic rules.
  - `ndarray_serde.rs`: Provides serialization for multi-dimensional arrays.
  - `basednodenet.rs`: Provides p2p communication between Brains. 
  - `mod.rs`: Exports key system components.

- **`interface`**: Provides a terminal-based user interface.
  - `widgets.rs`: Defines custom UI widgets like `CellDisplay` and `EnergyBar`.
  - `mod.rs`: Manages UI rendering and user interactions.

  - `logging.rs`: Provides structured and colored logging utilities.
  - `mod.rs`: Exports utility functions.

- **`main.rs`**: The entry point of the application, orchestrating the simulation.

### Data Storage

The system maintains several data stores:

1. **`eca_state.json`**
   - Stores the full colony state, including all cells and their properties.
   - Used for persistence and potential recovery.
   - Updated each simulation cycle.

2. **`data/thoughts/`**
   - Contains individual thought records in JSON format.
   - Each file represents a thought with associated metadata like relevance scores and timestamps.

3. **`data/plans/`**
   - Stores executed and current plans.
   - Organized by cycle and plan ID.
   - Includes success metrics and analysis results.

### Memory Management

- **Thought Compression**
  - Cells have a memory limit defined by `MAX_MEMORY_SIZE`.
  - When the limit is reached, older thoughts are compressed to conserve memory.
  - Compressed memories retain essential information for future decision-making.

- **Historical Context**
  - The system leverages historical data to influence cell evolution.
  - Past experiences shape behavior, promoting adaptation over time.

## OpenRouter Integration

The system requires an OpenRouter API key for advanced language model capabilities:

- **Thought Generation**: Cells generate new thoughts based on their context and real-time data.
- **Plan Creation**: Cells synthesize thoughts into actionable plans.
- **Memory Compression**: Older memories are compressed to essential information.
- **Context Analysis**: Real-time context is gathered and analyzed to inform cell behaviors.

### Setting Up OpenRouter API Key

Ensure your API key is correctly set in your environment:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your_openrouter_api_key_here'
```

The application reads this environment variable to authenticate API requests.

### Google Cloud Integration *(Optional)*

If you wish to use Google Cloud's Gemini model for additional AI capabilities, set the following environment variable:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT='your_google_cloud_project_id'
```

Refer to the [Google Cloud setup guide](https://cloud.google.com/docs/get-started) to configure your project and enable the necessary APIs.

**Note:** The Gemini integration is optional and requires additional setup, including authentication credentials and API enabling.

## Monitoring and Visualization

The system provides several ways to monitor and visualize the simulation:

- **Terminal User Interface (TUI)**
  - Real-time visualization within the terminal.
  - Displays cell grids, system logs, and status information.
  - Utilizes the `crossterm` and `ratatui` libraries for rendering.

- **WebSocket Server**
  - Runs on `localhost` port `3030`.
  - Allows external clients to connect and receive real-time updates.
  - Enables integration with custom dashboards or monitoring tools.

- **Logging**
  - Detailed, structured logs are output to the console.
  - Includes timestamps, metrics, and color-coded messages.
  - Uses custom logging utilities for enhanced readability.

## Data Analysis

Post-simulation analysis can be conducted by examining the data stored by the system:

- **View Latest Colony State**

  ```bash
  cat eca_state.json | jq
  ```

  Using `jq` helps format the JSON for readability.

- **Inspect Recent Thoughts**

  ```bash
  ls -l data/thoughts/
  ```

  Individual thought files can be viewed and analyzed for content and metadata.

- **Review Executed Plans**

  ```bash
  ls -l data/plans/
  ```

  Plans contain detailed steps and success metrics, which can be analyzed to understand the decision-making process.

- **Analyze Plan Performance**

  Since plans and their analyses are stored in JSON format, you can use tools like Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or data visualization software to parse and visualize the data.
